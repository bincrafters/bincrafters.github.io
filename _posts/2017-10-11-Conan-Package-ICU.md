Bincrafters has now published a Conan package for IBM's open-source libraries known as "ICU" to our public Conan repository on Bintray. ICU stands for "International Components for Unicode" and is a mature and portable set of libraries for software internationalization (I18N) and globalization (G11N) which implement the UnicodeÂ® Standard, giving applications the same results on all platforms."

ICU has been used for decades in C and C++ libraries and applications to handle unicode.  Major frameworks such as Boost and Qt both use it in various modules.
