title: 'CI Sponsorship Update - OpenCollective'

Bincrafters recently announced our intentions to take a step forward as an OSS group.  This included seeking sponsorhip and setting up an account to receive donations.  Our efforts were successful, and this post just explains a few things about our progress. 

## OpenCollective
If you're not familiar with OpenCollective, it's a service which sprung up specifically to help OSS teams like Bincrafters deal with funding.  We had originally joined Patreon to accept donations.  Patreon is a great service, however we had some concerns about how to manage the money as an OSS team (and the related taxes).  This video describes exactly the challenges we were antipcating when we started thinking about accepting donations, along with the additional services OpenCollective provides.

If you follow our twitter you saw our recent campaign to reach 100 stars on Github in order to qualify for OpenCollective, and we did so in just 3 days.  We are now members, and here is the link to our OpenCollective team profile:

##  Corporate Sponsorship from JFrog Bintray!
Shortly after announcing our fund-raising drive, we were contacted by the JFrog/Bintray team.  They have agreed to provide ongoing monthly sponsorhip for our CI services!  Currently, we're set to move forward on the premium Appveyor services, but we're having a bit of trouble with Travis.  They've confirmed that there is no plan for Bincrafters, which wants to have public repositories but pay for guaranteed builds slots for MacOS builds.  The good news is they're working on changing that, so stay tuned. 

## Continued Support
We've mentioned this before, but it bears repeating.  To our followers on Twitter and elsewhere, your support and promotion also matters, both on social media, and locally among developers you know or work with.  The rate of adoption and improvement with both Conan and Bincrafters is significantly impacted by word-of-mouth communication, coming from developers who actually use and enjoy Conan.  So, continued thanks to all of you.
