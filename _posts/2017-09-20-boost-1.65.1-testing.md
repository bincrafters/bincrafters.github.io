title: 'Conan Package - Boost 1.65.1 - Available for Testing'
tags: [C++, Conan.io, Boost]

Boost versions 1.65.0 and 1.65.1 were released recently. Due to the short time between these two releases, Bincrafters has skipped the packaging for version 1.65.0 and moved directly to packaging  1.65.1. The packages for 1.65.1 have been uploaded to Bintray and are now available for testing.  

## Example
```
[requires]
Boost.System/1.65.1@bincrafters/testing
```

## Status - Testing
Currently, these packages do not yet have a `stable` branch, however we expect to have that completed soon.  In the meantime, we are looking for beta testers to use the packages on the `testing` branch, but with the disclaimer that it should not be used for production code, and is subject to change at any time.
