title: 'Seeking CI Sponsorship'
tags: [C++, Conan.io]

Bincrafters is dedicated to creating, publishing, and maintaining Conan packages for important C/C++ libraries for the foreseeable future. On the horizon are some massive multi-library projects including Qt, as well as OpenCV and others. We're still trying to figure out all the logistics for those packages, but one thing is for sure: __CI has become a significant bottleneck to our packaging__. As such, we're looking for organizations who would be willing to provide recurring sponsorship for professional accounts on Travis CI and Appveyor, and Bintray. 

## Free CI Services for OSS
Travis, Appveyor, and Bintray all provide amazing public services for free.  We don't know how they do it, but we're grateful. It is these services which have enabled Bincrafters to exist in the first place.  We've been hitting the ceiling with each of these services on a regular basis, and engineered around them as best we could.  With free plans, Appveyor runs 1 concurrent job, Travis runs a few for linux, but Mac builds are bottlenecked to 2.  Also, Mac builds have regularly experienced issues which have caused them to be delayed multiple days.   In the face of continued growth, the limitations are simply untenable. 

Here you can view the link to Appveyor and Travis pricing and capacity limitations:

	[Bintray Pricing](https://bintray.com/account/pricing)  

As all the paid plans are tailored for non-OSS use, we have recently reached out to both Appveyor and Travis asking for custom pricing.  Something like an OSS+ plan, which simply increases concurrent job capacity. We will post an update here if either can accomodate, but in the meantime we will proceed as if we can only choose from the existing paid plans. 

## Total Monthly Funding Target
For paid plans on each of these services which would increase our concurrent build capacity in a meaningful way, we will need __a total of approximately $750 USD each month__.  We don't expect any single organization to contribute this amount.  Instead we are hoping to find several organizations who can commit to smaller monthly contributions. 

## In Return for Contribution
We want to show appreciation for any amount of financial support, so we have added a section on [the About page on our blog](https://bincrafters.github.io/about/) to feature, thank, and promote such sponsors.  As with any charitable donation, the idea behind showcasing sponsors publicly is that it might help bring positive attention to those sponsors, and possibly even business. 

## Other Support
We also want to let the community of followers on Twitter and elsewhere that your support and promotion also matters, both on social media, and locally among developers you know or work with.  The rate of adoption and improvement with both Conan and Bincrafters is significantly impacted by word-of-mouth communication, coming from developers who actually use and enjoy Conan.  So, continued thanks to our users.
