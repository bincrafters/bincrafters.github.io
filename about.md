## Background
Bincrafters began with a few developers who were each publishing Open-Source binary packages separately to Bintray, a cloud hosting service for Binary packages. While this is standard-practice in the Open-Source community, it creates several challenges for both the developers and the user community that might consume those packages. This lack a massive amount of duplicated of effort, and a lack of discoverability due to a sprawling of these packages across many separate repositories, among others. Bincrafters pools the time and diverse skills from multiple developers to publish and host high-quality packages in a small set of curated public repositories on Bintray.

## Open-Source Providers
Bincrafters would not exist if not for Github, Bintray, Travis-CI, and Appveyor. Each plays a critical role in the packaging pipeline, and we are very grateful to these companies for providing these services. 

## Sponsors
Bincrafters relies on recurring monthly donations from commercial organizations to pay for increased concurrent build capacity with our CI providers.  Our blog post about sponsorship here: [Bincrafters CI Sponsorship](https://bincrafters.github.io/2017/11/20/continuous-integration-sponsorship/).  Below is a list of our current sponsors, to whom we are extremely grateful:
