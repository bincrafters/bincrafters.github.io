    Bincrafters began with a few developers who were each publishing Open-Source binary packages separately to Bintray, a cloud hosting service for Binary packages. While this is standard-practice in the Open-Source community, it creates several challenges for both the developers and the user community that might consume those packages. This lack a massive amount of duplicated of effort, and a lack of discoverability due to a sprawling of these packages across many separate repositories, among others. Bincrafters pools the time and diverse skills from multiple developers to publish and host high-quality packages in a small set of curated public repositories on Bintray.
